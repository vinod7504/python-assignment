#PYTHON ASSIGNMENT

1.Armstrong number:
     This file tells about Armstrong numberthat if we power the each digit of the number with number of digits and add it. If we get the same number then it is called the armstrong number.
     
2.Date and Time:
    This file tells about the use of import function, And the applications of the import function. Importing of the time and finding the no of days left for the required day we can find out.
  
3.Fibnoccic Series:
    This file consists of the problem of fibnoccic series in which we can get the addition of two number leads to the third number. And swapping of the number takes place for the third number and the second number and this process goes on until the given number.
    
4.Largest number:
    This file consists of the programme for finding the largest number in the given number. This programme is done in the if-else condition.
    
5.Leap year:
    This file consisys of the programme for finding the given year is the leap year or not. By the given comditions we can sau that the year is the leap year or not
    
6.Multiplication Table:
    This file consists of the programme for finding the multiplication table for any number. In which this programme gibes the output in the form of the number*multipliler=result. 
    
7.Palindrome:
    This file consists of the programme for finding the given number is the palindrome or not. For the number to be palindrome if we reverse the number by doing some operattion if we get the same number then it is the palindrome if not it is not a palindrome.
    
8.Pascal Triangle:
    This file consists of the programme for finding the pascal triangle. In which if we give the number of lines then it prints the pascal traingle. The pascal traingle consits of the binomial coefficients only. In this the computer computes the values and gives the outputs.
    
9.Prime number:
    This file consists of the programme for finding the number of prime number and the prime number in between the upper and lower number. By using for loop we can do this programme.
    
10.Swapping of the number:
     This file consists of the programme for swappping of two number. It is the basic programme in which swapping of two number using an external variable takes place in which one number is substitued in the other varaible and the other number substituted in the 2nd number and swapping takes place.
                  
                  
                                                           Thank You sir
